medium.com is a publishing platform with a lot of interesting articles.

It has RSS feeds:
https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874118-RSS-feeds

For example:
medium.com/feed/the-atlantic

Build a single page app written with React. It should contain a text input box (and a submit button). The user:

1. Inputs a Medium user or account (like ‘the-atlantic’ above),
2. Clicks the submit button. 

The app then presents an RSS reader with the given Medium feed (it should be possible to see the contents of each article, who wrote it, and when).

Other than than, there aren’t many rules. Just think of a nice way to view articles and go for it. 

(If you want) You could use:
`create-react-app` - to bootstrap a React project
`material-ui` - for cool Material design components (look-and-feel)

But feel free to use whatever you feel like!

 Ideas (optional) for places to take it (you don’t have to pick from the list):

1. Make it look really well in mobile - done
2. Make it available offline (once you’ve seen an article once) - done
3. Make it show articles as they get published (in “real time”)
4. Make it really fast - done
5. Make it recommend other articles
6. Add cool transitions or animations… - done

Or anything cool you can think of.
